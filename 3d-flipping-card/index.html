                    Vienna, Austria’s capital city and former royal seat of the Austro-Hungarian empire, is one of Europe’s most beautiful cities. Due to its imperialist history, the historic districts of Vienna drip in opulence, now accessible to the non-royal among us. Few cities in Europe boast attractions to suit nearly every kind of traveler; those who love Paris will likely fall head-over-heels for the City of Music. Exploring Vienna is well worth a long week-end or more, as there are so many incredible things to see and do in this historic capital.
